# ‚ùì FAQ
Q: On which hideouts does it work?

_A: The application is designed for 'empty' hideouts such as Celestial Nebula, Infinite Abyss, and Endless Sands. So, it may not work on some other hideouts, but there‚Äôs a possible change in the app in the feature if needed._

Q: How can I move all of my hideout decorations at once?

_A: The application's 'Help' section guides the mass moving of decorations._

Q: What ranges of values should I assign to X and Y?

_A: Hideouts have a size of 400x400, suggested values for X and Y range from -200 to 200. Note that if a decoration lies outside these bounds, its position may not be altered._

# üí° Other Hints
* If you experience 'write access denied' messages while saving on the C drive, running the app as an administrator might resolve the issue.

* The 'Save to' field is optional. If left unchanged, the app will overwrite the existing .hideout file.

* PoE's axis is turned, so:
  - X to move decorations towards the top-right.
  - Y to shift them to the top-left.
  - Negative values move decorations in opposite directions. 

* More settings can be added within the application if need be.
